Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (toplevel and compiler)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.
 For more information, see <http://coq.inria.fr/>.
 .
 This packages provides coqtop, a command line interface to Coq.
 .
 A graphical interface for Coq is provided in the coqide package.
 Coq can also be used with ProofGeneral, which allows proofs to be
 edited using emacs and xemacs. This requires the proofgeneral-coq
 package to be installed.

Description: development libraries and tools for Coq
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.

 .
 This package provides coqmktop, and libraries needed to develop
 OCaml-side extensions to Coq.
