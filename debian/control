Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (toplevel and compiler)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp4.
 For more information, see <http://coq.inria.fr/>.
 .
 This packages provides coqtop, a command line interface to Coq.
 .
 A graphical interface for Coq is provided in the coqide package.
 Coq can also be used with ProofGeneral, which allows proofs to be
 edited using emacs and xemacs. This requires the proofgeneral-coq
 package to be installed.

Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (gtk interface)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp4.
 For more information, see <http://coq.inria.fr/>.
 .
 This package provides CoqIde, a graphical user interface for
 developing proofs.

Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (theories)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp4.
 For more information, see <http://coq.inria.fr/>.
 .
 This package provides existing theories that new proofs can be
 based upon, including theories of arithmetic and Boolean values.

Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (Coq 7 theories)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp4.
 For more information, see <http://coq.inria.fr/>.
 .
 This package provides existing theories from Coq 7 in Coq 8, and
 allows proofs that were developed in Coq 7 to be used in Coq 8.
 It is also required to translate theories in Coq 7 syntax into
 the new syntax introduced in Coq 8. However, this package does
 not need to be installed to use Coq 7.
