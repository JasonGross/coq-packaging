Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (toplevel and compiler)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.
 .
 This package provides coqtop, a command line interface to Coq.
 .
 A graphical interface for Coq is provided in the coqide package.
 Coq can also be used with ProofGeneral, which allows proofs to be
 edited using emacs and xemacs. This requires the proofgeneral
 package to be installed.

Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (gtk interface)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.

Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (theories)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.
 .
 This package provides existing theories that new proofs can be
 based upon, including theories of arithmetic and Boolean values.
