  This version contains modifications by Lionel Elie Mamane
  <lionel@mamane.lu> done while under employment of the Radboud
  University Nijmegen. However, no copyright-assignment-to-employer
  agreement was signed, and copyright of articles and books written on
  work time rest with the employee. By analogy, it is Lionel's opinion
  that copyright on these changes rests with him.
