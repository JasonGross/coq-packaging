Coq includes a tactic Jp based on JProver, a theorem prover for
first-order intuitionistic logic.  Jprover was originally implemented
by Stephan Schmitt and then integrated into MetaPRL by Aleksey
Nogin. After this, Huang extracted the necessary ML-codes from MetaPRL
and then integrated it into Coq.
