coq (8.0pl2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rebuilding with OCaml 3.08.3 is necessary because of the former dependency
    on ocaml-base-nox-3.08.
  * Removed the dependency on ocaml-base-nox-3.08 since ocamlrun does not seem
    to be necessary, even on non-native archs.
  * Cleaner handling of -arch and -indep targets.
  * Added utf8.v in coq and utf8.vo to coq-libs since utf8 can be useful for
    non-coqide users too.
  * Using dh_desktop to register .desktop files.

 -- Samuel Mimram <smimram@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Mar 2005 17:40:08 +0100

    /usr/share/applications/ to be compliant with the policy.
  * Description synopsis now begin with lowercase letters.

coq (7.2-9) unstable; urgency=low
  * ocamlc.opt completely broken on powerpc. Added a special case in
    "rules" for using only bytecode.

 -- Judicael Courant <Judicael.Courant@lri.fr>  Fri, 15 Feb 2002 09:17:20 +0100

coq (7.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * "timeout" time is now 5300s (< 90 min).

 -- Judicael Courant <Judicael.Courant@lri.fr>  Thu, 14 Feb 2002 17:38:06 +0100

coq (7.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build now uses ocamlc.opt and ocamlopt.opt if available.
  * Dependency forced on ocaml >= 3.04 (dependency ocaml >=3.04 | camlp4
    does not make buildd happy. See http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?
    &pkg=coq&ver=7.2-5&arch=arm&stamp=1013388706&file=log&as=raw).

coq (7.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Typo in rules, which made the build process always build in
    bytecode. Fixed.

 -- Judicael Courant <Judicael.Courant@lri.fr>  Mon, 11 Feb 2002 11:22:21 +0100

coq (7.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pb with timeout, used in 7.2-4 (bug 132927) making the build process
    fail when compilation in native mode fails. Workaround in rules: after
    a "timeout ... make ..." we try a "make -q" to check that everything
    has been done correctly.

 -- Judicael Courant <Judicael.Courant@lri.fr>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 10:08:10 +0100

coq (7.2-4) unstable; urgency=low
  * Native code compilation failed on sparc; coqtop built by ocamlopt
    entered an infinite loop on powerpc. Fixed (using timeout for powerpc:
    if coqtop loops, it is rebuild using the bytecode compiler)

 -- Judicael Courant <Judicael.Courant@lri.fr>  Fri,  1 Feb 2002 11:04:25 +0100

coq (7.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depends now requires camlp4 instead of camlp4 (>=3.01) since
    camlp4 is a virtual package provided by ocaml >=3.04.

 -- Judicaël Courant <Judicael.Courant@lri.fr>  Fri, 11 Jan 2002 11:08:03 +0100

coq (6.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some changes to allow successful porting of this package:
